Pascal Nyan created with Virtual Pascal 2.1 by Ross Meikleham


Instructions for running from executable:

Copy the executable file along with the wav files into a folder, 
then run the executable from that folder



Instructions for running from source code:

open testnyan.pas in virtual pascal and compile, wav files will need to be
placed in 'C:\Documents and Settings\'Yourname'' as the sound files are searched
for in the 'current directory' and when run from compiler the current directory becomes
that.

If the compiler cannot find the MMSYSTEM unit then open the one provided and compile
before compiling the original program, alternatively the MMSYSTEM unit can be found in
C:\vp21\source\w32

Alternatively for running with sound, in the source code just replace all
"Dir+'\nyanlooped.wav';" "Dir+'\nyan8bit.wav';" and "Dir+'\SelectOption'" with custom
file paths.


enjoy :)
