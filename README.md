#Pascal Code

This repository contains code mostly written during
2009 - 2011 when I was first learning to program.
Uncommented/Badly Commented Spaghetti code lies ahead. 

I've went back and moved some of the more noteable programs
into their own folders.

Compiling these programs requires the horribly outdated and Windows only 
[Virtual Pascal Compiler](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Coding-languages-Compilers/Virtual-Pascal.shtml). Open up the "main" source
file for a program in the Virtual Pascal IDE and select `Compile->Build` andthen `Run` to run the given program.

In the future I would like to port a couple of these programs to [Free Pascal](www.freepascal.org) using the ncurses library to port the text-based interface to Linux + OSX.
